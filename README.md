# Perceptron-LDA-LogisticRegression

### Overview
This was part of a college machine learning assignment. In this, we implemented Perceptron Algorithm, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Logistic Regression from scratch without using any existing libraries.

The dataset and the detailed analysis of the comparison between these techniques are also uploaded for reference.
For each of the models, different techniques, like normalization, missing values, etc., were also implemented to check the effect of each technique on different models.
